            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold py-2">Personal review</h2>
            <p class="text-lg py-2">Many will call this a copy of Solo Leveling, 
                however the moment you give it a try you notice 
                that it couldn't be further from the truth.</p>
            <p class="text-lg py-2">I love this novel and has become one of my 
                all time favorites. At the beginning it's 
                a bit slow and some plot points feel disjointed 
                (this gets better further on, as the author 
                gains experience); however the character 
                building never misses. Geunso is stellar when 
                it comes to explore the characters and their 
            relationships.</p>
            <p class="text-lg py-2">Unlike many stories (novels and manhwas alike), 
                this one lacks a romantic subplot. Yet, in my eyes, 
                it's the one that delves deeper into themes of love and all 
                the forms it could take besides the romantic love media has 
                us all used to. From the love shown between brothers, to the 
                one shown between a parent towards their kids, to the bond 
                shared between kindred souls. The nuance and layers each 
                relationship shows and how it changes through chapters it's 
                poetic and beautiful to read.</p>
            <p class="text-lg py-2">
                My favorite part of the novel is how the author portrays Han Yoojin's 
                mental state through narration. We meet the protagonist at a deeply unstable 
                point in his life, saying he was at rock bottom wouldn't feel like an exaggeration 
                and most of the novel is seen through his rather askew point of view, his impulses, 
                self-loathing and normalization of pain lead us through this magnificent world of 
                monsters and hunters. Yoojin is one of the best examples of an unreliable narrator, 
                with his true colors and emotions flowing slowly through cracks requiring the audience 
                to read between lines and uncover the lies he tells to himself for his own peace of mind. 
                I find it a pity how the manhwa failed to show the most crocked sides of this character in favor 
                of comedy and a lower PG-rating. 
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg py-2">I could spend numerous paragraphs talking about the novel and it's writing, however this review would 
                turn into a retelling or essay instead. I would recommend anyone to read this novel more so if you enjoy 
                character driven stories with complex characters and relationships left and right.
